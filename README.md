## weather app 2.0

*What changed?*
Initially the weather app was all done client side. This time around I incorporated Node/Express & friends :)

User Stories:

* can see weather in current location

* can see a different icon or background image depending on the weather

* can push a button to toggle between fahrenheit and celsius  


Weather App uses:  

* *Geolocation* to find latitude/longitude 

* *Geocode* to translate latitude/longitude into human-friendly readable data (ie: city and state)

* *Dark Sky* for weather data according to latitude/longitude

* *Skycons* animated icons that change depending on weather
